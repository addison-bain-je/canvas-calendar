Calendar View on Canvas App

Calendars are a common feature in collaborative-type apps, where teams use this to share events, schedule resources and employees to track work hours.  
However, there is no out-of-the-box Calendar screen component available in canvas app.  
Here, I have created a basic calendar view with nested galleries and some custom logic, and functionalities to add/update/remove events on the calendar.

The backend data source is a simple SharePoint List named ```SampleEventsList``` consisting of these columns:
| Column Name       | Data Type |
| :---------------- | ------:   |
| Title             | Single line of text    |
| StartDateTime     | Date & Time            |
| EndDateTime       | Date & Time            |
| Description       | Multiple lines of text |

The app package can be found in the repo.
